# Bluetooth Arduino RC Car

**1st Year University Project** <br/>
**Semester 1** <br/>
**Programming Fundamentals**

For this Assignment I was tasked with creating something unique using an Arduino UNO.

I Decided since I was a fan of Robot Wars to develop something similar in the form of an RC Car.
Initially the car was designed to have a Camera and Microphone within its arsenal however it was deemed out of scope and expensive.

However the Car overall was fun to play with and work on with both the software side and hardware side.

 **Features:** <br/>
 Bluetooth Remote Control <br/>
 2 Wheel Drive Steering <br/>
 Horn Buzzer <br/>
 Led to indicate Movement <br/>
 
 **Skills Demonstrated:** <br/>
  Basic PWM Knowledge <br/>
  Simple Programming Concepts <br/>
